## test assertions

### Should NOT record (party member loot):
- Line 10: "Zaraboz receives loot: [Hezrul's Head]." → 0 items
- Line 15: "Seynttodeath receives loot: [Hezrul's Head]." → 0 items
- Line 18: "Darthmalaga receives loot: [Linen Cloth]x2." → 0 items (multiple variant)
- Line 19: "Darthmalaga receives loot: [Hezrul's Head]." → 0 items

### SHOULD record (player loot):
- Line 14: "You receive loot: [Hezrul's Head]." → 1 item
- Line 27: "You receive item: [Bounty Hunter's Ring]." → 1 item (pushed variant)

### Money should still work:
- Lines 11, 13, 17: "Your share of the loot is X Copper." → 22c total

## test 2 - multiple count parsing (synthetic)

### Self multiple:
- "You receive loot: [Linen Cloth]x5." → should record 5 items

### Other multiple (if player name matches):
- "PlayerName receives loot: [Linen Cloth]x3." → should record 3 items (only if PlayerName == UnitName("player"))

### Pushed multiple:
- "You receive item: [Quest Item]x2." → should record 2 items
