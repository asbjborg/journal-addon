# Overview

Agents must follow this strict workflow when working on issues:

1. **Implement** - Make code changes for ONE issue at a time
2. **Deploy** - Run `deploy.sh` to deploy changes for testing
   - **Bump version in `JournalingAddon/JournalingAddon.toc` FIRST** (before deploy)
   - Update `changes.md` with the new changes when deploying
   - Create a NEW version section at the top (never add to already-committed versions)
   - Version in `.toc` must match the version in `changes.md`
3. **Test** - Wait for user to test before proceeding
4. **Commit** - Only commit after successful testing and user approval
5. **Close** - Only close issue after commit is complete

## Critical Rules

- **ONE issue at a time** - Never work on multiple issues simultaneously unless explicitly asked
- **Deploy before commit** - Always deploy and test before committing
- **No premature commits** - Never commit or close issues before deployment and testing
- **Wait for approval** - Wait for user confirmation after each step before proceeding

## Workflow Exception

- when explicitly told by the user to work on multiple issues or skip steps.
- when not working on issues related to the journal addon.
