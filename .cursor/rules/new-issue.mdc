# Overview

**note: remote repo is https://github.com/asbjborg/journal-addon**

Agents must use the appropriate issue templates found in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` when creating new issues. Select the template that best matches the nature of the issue:
- **Bug Report** - for bugs and issues
- **Feature Request** - for completely new features
- **Change Request** - for improvements/modifications to existing features

Ensure all relevant template sections are completed to provide sufficient context and detail.

## Labels/Tags

**Do NOT include labels in issue titles** - use GitHub labels instead:

- **`feature`** - New feature or request (use for brand new features)
- **`change`** - Change/improvement to an existing feature (use for enhancements to existing features)
- **`bug`** - Something isn't working (bug reports)
- **`documentation`** - Improvements or additions to documentation
- **`question`** - Further information is requested
- **`duplicate`** - This issue already exists
- **`invalid`** - This doesn't seem right
- **`wontfix`** - This will not be worked on

**When to use `feature` vs `change`:**
- Use `feature` for completely new functionality
- Use `change` for improvements, refinements, or modifications to existing features

The templates will automatically apply the correct label. For manual issue creation or when using templates, ensure the correct label is selected.
