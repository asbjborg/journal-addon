# Story-beat-writer docs

- **wowhead-html-parsing.md** – Where Wowhead quest data is extracted from in the HTML.
- **output_example.jsonl** – Example of enriched JSONL output (one line per event). Quest events have `data.questContext` with Wowhead data. Use this as the target shape: edit the example to show the format you want, then we adjust the code to match.
